# Exalt  

An alternative C standard library for educational purposes

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to reimplement a reasonable amount of common
libc functionality with nice interfaces, types, and naming. It is **not** intended
to be a production system, and is only for educational purposes (mostly mine but
hopefully others as well).
